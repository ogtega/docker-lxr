# CAUTION!
#	This script considers lighttpd listens by default on port :80
#	and does not list it to avoid duplicates. If port :80 is not
#	enabled and one of the hosts does not reference an explicit
#	port, a socket directive for port :80 must then be written.
# # # # # # # # # # #
# If incoming requests can arrive simultaneously on several ports,
# you can add blocks (one per port) of the form:
#	$HTTP["socket"] =~ ":XX$" {}	# with XX = port number
# IMPORTANT! Remove duplicates
